DFASimulatorV2
==============

This is DFA Simulator, originally found here: http://home.arcor.de/kai.w1986/dfasimulator/ 

I made a few chages to it, like adding the output feature for transitions.

Also I'm working on a feature to export the transitions and states table and the properties of the DFA and an import feature that imports a DFA from a state table
