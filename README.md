DFASimulatorV2
==============

Description
-------------

This is DFA Simulator, originally found here: http://home.arcor.de/kai.w1986/dfasimulator/ 

I made a few chages to it, like adding the output feature for transitions.

Also I'm working on a feature to export the transitions and states table and the properties of the DFA and an import feature that imports a DFA from a state table

Build
-------------

**I will not provide any precompiled JAR-File here and you should really compile it for yourself.**

You will need NetBeans for this (Maybe I'll export it for eclipse later, the original author was using NetBeans so I used it as well).

Clone the project via git and go to `File`->`Open Project...` and select the project.
Now build it for yourself (Hit `F11` or `Run`->`Build`)
You'll find the JAR-File in `Project-Root-Folder/dist`
